# krry.me

## Beginnings

We feel full to know the beginning
and empty to know the end.

[This lil' app](https://vladocar.github.io/Minimal-Notes/) sparked the idea for a live personal idea wall.

I've been struggling to know what goes at krry.me for far too long. May the effulgence of this struggle be palpable once this repo is cloneable.
